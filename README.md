Example to replicate issue connecting to Chromecast from Chrome on iOS

## Problem

When connecting to a custom Chromecast app from Chrome on iOS the connection always fails. 

The iPhone can see the Chromecast being available but after connection has been established it receives an error. 
The error occurs when ``castReceiverManager.start();`` is called. How soon ``start()`` is called doesn't have any impact.

Log:

```
10:25:20.130: Session error: {"code":"channel_error","description":"The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (com.google.chrome.ios.cast error 2.)"} 
10:25:08.669: Starting session 
10:25:05.979: Receiver available 
10:25:05.942: Cast initialized 
10:25:05.851: Starting Sender for app id B030C4BA with namespace urn:x-cast:akupila.chromecast.test
```

## Expected

Chromecast should connect and start sending messages ping-pong
